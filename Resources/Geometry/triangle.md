# Properties of a Triangle

A **triangle** is a polygon with three sides, three vertices, and three angles. The basic properties of a triangle are as follows:

### 1. Sum of Interior Angles:
- The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always **$180^\circ$**.
$$
\text{Angle 1} + \text{Angle 2} + \text{Angle 3} = 180^\circ
$$

### 2. Types of Triangles:
- **By Sides**:
  - **Equilateral Triangle**: All sides are equal, and all angles are 60°.
  - **Isosceles Triangle**: Two sides are equal, and the angles opposite those sides are also equal.
  - **Scalene Triangle**: All sides and angles are different.

- **By Angles**:
  - **Acute Triangle**: All angles are less than 90°.
  - **Right Triangle**: One angle is exactly 90°.
  - **Obtuse Triangle**: One angle is greater than 90°.

### 3. Area of a Triangle:
- The area can be calculated using base and height:
$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height}
$$

- Or using **Heron’s Formula** when all sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are known:
$$
\text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
$$
where \(s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}\) (the semi-perimeter).

### 4. Perimeter of a Triangle:
- The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides:
$$
\text{Perimeter} = a + b + c
$$

# Pythagorean Triplet

A **Pythagorean triplet** is a set of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy the Pythagorean theorem:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

### Examples of Pythagorean Triplets:
- **(3, 4, 5)**: This is the most well-known triplet.
$$
3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2
$$

- **(5, 12, 13)**:
$$
5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169 = 13^2
$$

- **(7, 24, 25)**:
$$
7^2 + 24^2 = 49 + 576 = 625 = 25^2
$$

### Properties of Pythagorean Triplets:
1. **Primitive Triplets**: A Pythagorean triplet is called primitive if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is 1.
   - Example: **(3, 4, 5)** is a primitive triplet.
2. **Multiplying a Triplet**: Multiplying a Pythagorean triplet by a constant \(k\) results in another valid Pythagorean triplet.
   - For instance, multiplying **(3, 4, 5)** by 2 gives **(6, 8, 10)**, which is also a valid triplet.
